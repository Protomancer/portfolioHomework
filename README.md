## Usage
    -The nav links will link to corresponding page sections
    -the first project site is linked can be loaded on clicking the box.
    -contact links have been placed in the bottom of the page
    -A placeholder image has been used for my cover photo
    -the site will resize to tablets and wide sceens fairly well
    -small screens will suffer overlap until i can work that out.
